# Running NorESM in a container

## What is a container?

A **container** is a unit of software that bundles a code and all its dependencies so that an application can run quickly in various computing environments

A container **image** is a standalone, executable package of software which includes everything needed to run an application: source code, compilers, libraries, etc.

Images *become* containers **at runtime** when they run on a container engine (like Docker, Singularity, etc.)

Docker is probably the most popular platform for creating and distributing container images

It is very easy to install (especially on Linux machines) and well documented

## Docker for everything? <img src="https://w7.pngwing.com/pngs/636/195/png-transparent-warning-sign-traffic-sign-hazard-warning-signs-text-logo-copyright-thumbnail.png" height="40">

Docker works well for local or **private** resources, and 

- [x] it is great to **develop** and **share** ([Docker-hub](https://hub.docker.com))

- [x] Docker images are built layer by layer from a *recipe* called Dockerfile, and should something fail in a particular layer, one can just fix it and resume the build from where it stopped

however, Docker is

- [ ] not suitable for **multi-user** environments like High Performance Computers (HPC) because processes within the Docker container are executed with root privileges

and therefore no *sensible* **HPC** centers will allow it

## Singularity <img src="https://sylabs.io/assets/svg/singularity-logo.svg" height="40">

Compared to Docker, Singularity exhibits several features which make it more suitable for use on HPC, and in particular:

- [x] there is **no privilege** escalation inside Singularity containers (user outside == user inside)

- [x] it does not requires any system changes for **HPC**

- [x] it provides a simple integration with **resource managers** (like Slurm)

Also, from the user point-of view:

- [x] Singularity uses a single-file based container format (**SIFâ„¢** = Singularity Image File)

- [x] it supports multiple **architectures** (x86-64, PPC, <img src="https://www.arm.com/-/media/global/logos/Arm-logo-reverse-white.svg?h=175&w=300&hash=F5A828FC9C66575A911DF0B5CB3D04B4E8E5DC50&hash=F5A828FC9C66575A911DF0B5CB3D04B4E8E5DC50" height="25">)

however

- [ ] building container images from a Singularity definition file (.def) is tedious (although the content is *similar* to that of a Dockerfile)

- [x] it is possible to convert a Docker image into Singularity

- [x] the size of a Singularity Image File is significantly smaller than the *equivalent* Docker image archive
