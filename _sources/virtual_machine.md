# On the Virtual Machine

Login with the **private SSH key** corresponding to the public key that you provided the Organizers of this Workshop:

```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/YourPrivateSSHkey ubuntu@158.39.48.xxx
```

Each VM features 16 VCPUs + 64GB RAM + 80GB root disk, and already comes with Singularity

:::{note}
Replace *158.39.48.xxx* by the IP address that you have been allocated (although you all have the same user name on these Virtual Machines)
