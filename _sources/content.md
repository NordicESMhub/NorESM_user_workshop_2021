Objectives of this training
===========================

Learn how to use a Singularity container to setup and run NorESM (release 2.0.5) on different platforms:


* a Virtual Machine with **Intel® Haswell** Processors (@ Norwegian Research & Education Cloud)

* a High Performance Computer with **AMD® Rome** Processors (Betzy @ Sigma2)

![Two different ways to interact with a container](/Inside-outside.gif)

The "inside-out" approach is more suited for single-node hosts, typically personal computers or Virtual Machines, whereas running on multiple-nodes can only be achieved from the "outside-in".

In this session you will see how to run NorESM in a container following these two approaches.
